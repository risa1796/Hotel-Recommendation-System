# 🏨 Hotel Recommendation System

Recommendation ideas.. 

## 📍 1. Find hotels near me! 

  Given your location, 10 hotels near to you will be recommended. Your location is marked as blue and the nearest hotel : red. 
  When you click a hotel mark, it will automatically lead you to the corresponding Booking.com page to see more information about the hotel. 
  
  I used the 'Folium' library to visualize hotel locations in Google Map.
